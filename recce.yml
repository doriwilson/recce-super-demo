- name: Schema diff
  description: Check the schema diff for all nodes.

- name: Customer Orders Date Validation
  description: Validate UTC date conversion in customer_orders date columns. Automatically runs when customer_orders or its upstream dependencies (like stg_orders) change. Focuses on first_order_date and last_order_date to ensure dates only shift 0 or +1 day from EST→UTC conversion.
  type: value_diff
  params:
    model: customer_orders
    primary_key: customer_id
    # This check will automatically run when:
    # - customer_orders model is modified
    # - Any upstream model (like stg_orders, orders) that affects customer_orders changes
    # Recce will compare all columns, but you can focus on date columns in the UI
